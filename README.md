Materials for the evaluation of restoration projects using Bayes Decision Networks.

# Data

Files in `/data/` all created using `R/dat_proc.R`, unless otherwise noted

* `grdsres.RData` grid analyses of year/site match combos for different bn models, created in `R/source_me.R`

* `map.RData` base map for plots in `all_eval.Rmd` created in same file

* `restdat.RData` restoration projects combined

* `reststat.RData` location of restoration projects combined

* `wqdat.RData` TB water quality data by site, date, var, val

* `wqmtch.RData` Match between water quality stations and restoration site locations, for manuscript

* `wqstat.RData` TB water quality stations as lat/lon
